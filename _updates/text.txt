MEET THE CHEF

I am Veronique, a native of Paris, France.

I grew up in the french tradition where bread and pastry recipes were passed down from generation to generation. They were made fresh daily with love!

My passion for baking came alive in 2015. I wanted to recreate the french pastries from my childhood that I was missing. I enrolled in a local college with an extensive Baking program. My teacher was a French chef who taught in the authentic European tradition. My passion for baking and bringing a taste of Europe was able to come true!


MY MISSION

My mission is to create an incredible authentic culinary experience.

I want each bite of buttery, flaky, taste of heaven to melt in your mouth!

I use only the freshest ingredients like European butter, almonds, and fresh fruits.

I will strive to provide my customers the best quality baked items with no chemical additives.
