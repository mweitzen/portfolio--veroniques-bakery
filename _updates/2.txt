Change Delivery option from ZipCode to full address.
Also, please change the price of the large tarts (both the lemon and almond) from $22 to $25.

NEW LOGIC NEEDED:

Select pickup/delivery times on Saturdays only.

Add an additional $10 fee for orders equal to and between $20 - $39.99.

Do not allow a delivery option for orders under $20.

Pickups can be scheduled for Saturdays from 1:00pm - 6:00pm.

Deliveries can be scheduled for Saturdays from 2:00pm - 6:00pm.

If the order is on or after 12:00am Friday morning, then the pickup or delivery cannot be scheduled for the current Saturday so the default date should be the following Saturday.

See the language below that has been approved by Veronique for the info sections.

Do not allow delivery option if the full address provided is more than 10 miles away from the kitchen.
